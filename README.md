# ImageDehazing
This project is the final course project of course ECE 573 Computer Vision, under the instruction of Dr. Mongi Abidi.

This project provides a C++ implementation of Non-Local Image Dehazing Algorithm (CVPR 2016) based on OpenCV.

The file ImageDehazing.cpp gives the source code of this project.

The file Computer Vison Presentation gives an introduction to the principles of dehazing algorithm and implementation method, including background, image hazing model, air light estimation, and data structures like k-dimentional tree.

The folder Image contains related images in the Presentation.

Pre-installed OpenCV (C++) is needed to run the source code.
